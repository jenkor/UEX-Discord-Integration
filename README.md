- ‚úÖ Use `environment-variables.example` as a template
- ‚úÖ Keep your `.env` file in `.gitignore` (never commit it)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **GitHub Account**: For version control and Netlify deployment
2. **Netlify Account**: Sign up free at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. **Discord Server**: With a channel for notifications
4. **UEX Corp Account**: With API access enabled

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

## üß™ Testing

### Verify Deployment
1. Visit your health check endpoint:
   ```
   https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health
   ```
2. You should see a JSON response with configuration status

### Test UEX ‚Üí Discord Notifications
1. Create a negotiation in UEX Corp
2. Check your Discord channel for notifications
3. **‚úÖ This should work immediately after setup**

### Test Discord ‚Üí UEX Replies (Requires Additional Setup)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Typing `/reply` in Discord **won't work yet** because Discord doesn't know our functions exist!

**Quick Option**: Use manual function call:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/discord-command \
  -H "Authorization: your_auth_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"/reply abc123 Hello World"}'
```

**Full Option**: Set up Discord bot for `/reply` slash commands - see [DISCORD-SETUP.md](DISCORD-SETUP.md)

## üìñ Usage

### Receiving Notifications
When someone starts a negotiation or replies in UEX, you'll see:

```
üîî New UEX Message
Polaris - LTI Package

üë§ From: TraderName
üìù Message: "Interested in this package, what's your best price?"

üí¨ Reply Command
/reply abc123def your message here

Negotiation: abc123def
```

### Sending Replies
To reply from Discord:

```
/reply abc123def I can offer 15% off for immediate payment
```

You'll get a confirmation:

```
‚úÖ Reply Sent Successfully
Reply sent to negotiation: abc123def
Message: "I can offer 15% off for immediate payment"
```

## üîß API Details

### UEX API Integration

- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: `secret_key` header
- **Parameters**:
  - `hash`: Negotiation hash from webhook

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Check Function Logs
1. Go to Netlify **Site overview** ‚Üí **Functions**
2. Click on any function to see recent logs
3. Look for error messages or failed requests

### Common Issues

**Discord notifications not appearing:**
- Verify `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is correct
- Check UEX webhook configuration
- Look at function logs for errors

**Replies not sending to UEX:**
- Verify `UEX_SECRET_KEY` is correct
- Check if secret key has proper permissions
- Test the health endpoint for connectivity

**Function timeout errors:**
- Functions have 10-second timeout
- Large responses may need optimization
- Check for infinite loops or blocking calls

### Manual Testing

Test individual functions locally:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Start local development
netlify dev

# Test webhook function
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/uex-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"negotiation_hash":"test123","last_message":"Hello","sender_username":"TestUser","listing_title":"Test Listing"}'
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Checks
Monitor your integration at:
```
https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health
```

### Netlify Analytics
- View function usage in Netlify dashboard
- Monitor deployment history
- Track error rates and response times

### Discord Logging
All function activity is logged to Netlify, including:
- Webhook receptions from UEX
- Discord message sending
- API calls to UEX
- Error conditions

## üîí Security

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit credentials to git/GitHub**
2. **Use webhook signatures** for validation (set `UEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
3. **Monitor function logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Limit Discord permissions** to minimum required
5. **Rotate API keys regularly**
6. **Keep environment variables secure in Netlify only**

### Rate Limiting
- Netlify: 125,000 function invocations/month (free tier)
- Discord: ~5 requests/second (webhook)
- UEX: Check their API documentation for limits

## üÜô Upgrades

### Netlify Pro Features
If you need more capacity:
- **Pro Plan**: $19/month for 2M function invocations
- **Background Functions**: For long-running tasks
- **Edge Functions**: For faster response times

### Additional Features
This integration can be extended with:
- **Web Dashboard**: For managing negotiations
- **Database Storage**: For persistent data
- **Email Notifications**: As backup to Discord
- **Mobile App**: Using same API endpoints
