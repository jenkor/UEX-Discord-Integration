# Troubleshooting Guide

**Solutions to common problems and how to diagnose issues**

This guide will help you fix the most common problems people encounter when setting up or using the UEX-Discord integration.

## üö® Quick Diagnosis

**Start here:** Check your integration's health status.

### Health Check Steps
1. Go to: `https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health`
2. Look at the response to understand what's wrong

**Good Response (Everything Working):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "configuration": {
      "configured": {
        "discord_webhook_url": true,
        "discord_channel_id": true,
        "uex_api_token": true,
        "uex_secret_key": true
      }
    },
    "connectivity": {
      "discord": {"status": "healthy"},
      "uex": {"status": "reachable"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Problem Indicators:**
- ‚ùå `"status": "error"`
- ‚ùå Any variables showing `false`
- ‚ùå Connectivity showing `"error"`

## üîß Environment Variable Problems

### Problem: "Missing UEX API configuration"

**Symptoms:**
- Health check shows UEX variables as `false`
- Error messages about missing UEX_API_TOKEN or UEX_SECRET_KEY

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Netlify Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Verify you have all 4 required variables:
     - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
     - `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`
     - `UEX_API_TOKEN`
     - `UEX_SECRET_KEY`

2. **Redeploy After Adding Variables:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí Deploys
   - Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

3. **Check Variable Values:**
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces
   - Verify you copied the complete values
   - UEX_API_TOKEN and UEX_SECRET_KEY should be different values

### Problem: Variables showing as `false` in health check

**Cause:** Netlify functions can't see your environment variables.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify variable names are EXACT:**
   ```
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL  ‚úÖ Correct
   discord_webhook_url  ‚ùå Wrong (case sensitive)
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URl  ‚ùå Wrong (typo)
   ```

2. **Redeploy is required:**
   - Environment variables only take effect after redeployment
   - Always redeploy after adding/changing variables

3. **Check for typos in values:**
   - Discord webhook should start with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
   - Channel ID should be 17-19 digits
   - UEX keys should be long random strings

## üí¨ Discord Problems

### Problem: "Not getting Discord notifications"

**Symptoms:**
- Health check shows Discord as `false` or `error`
- UEX messages aren't appearing in Discord
- No error messages

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Test Discord Webhook Manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "Test message from webhook"}'
   ```
   If this doesn't work, your webhook URL is wrong.

2. **Check Webhook URL Format:**
   - Should look like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890123456789/abcdef...`
   - Should be the COMPLETE URL, not just part of it
   - Should not have extra characters or spaces

**Solutions:**
1. **Recreate Discord Webhook:**
   - Go to Discord ‚Üí Your channel ‚Üí Edit Channel ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Delete old webhook
   - Create new webhook
   - Copy the FULL URL
   - Update Netlify environment variable

2. **Check Discord Channel Permissions:**
   - Make sure the channel still exists
   - Verify you have permission to create webhooks
   - Try creating webhook in a different channel

### Problem: "Discord webhook returns error 404"

**Cause:** Webhook was deleted or URL is incorrect.

**Solution:**
1. Create a new webhook in Discord
2. Update the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in Netlify
3. Redeploy your site

## üü® UEX Corp Problems

### Problem: "Authentication error" from UEX

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `{"status":"not_allowed","http_code":403,"message":"Sorry. Authentication error."}`
- Health check shows UEX as unreachable

**Solutions:**
1. **Check UEX Key Expiration:**
   - Log into UEX Corp
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí API or My Apps
   - Generate new API token and secret key if needed
   - Update Netlify environment variables

2. **Verify Both Keys Are Set:**
   - You need BOTH `UEX_API_TOKEN` AND `UEX_SECRET_KEY`
   - They should be different values
   - Both should be long random strings

3. **Check UEX Account Status:**
   - Make sure your UEX Corp account is in good standing
   - Verify you have API access enabled
   - Contact UEX support if you can't access API settings

### Problem: "UEX API not responding"

**Symptoms:**
- Health check shows UEX connectivity as `error`
- Timeout errors when trying to send replies

**Solutions:**
1. **Check UEX Corp Status:**
   - Visit [UEX Corp](https://uexcorp.space) to see if it's down
   - Check their status page or social media

2. **Verify API Endpoint:**
   - The integration uses: `https://api.uexcorp.space/2.0/marketplace_negotiations_messages/`
   - If UEX Corp changed their API, this might need updating

## üåê Netlify Problems

### Problem: "Site not deploying"

**Symptoms:**

   - Verify publish directory is `public`
   - Check that your repository is connected correctly

### Problem: "Functions returning 503 errors"

**Symptoms:**
- Health check returns 503 Service Unavailable
- All functions return server errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for Deploy to Complete:**
   - Deployments can take 2-3 minutes
   - Don't test functions until deploy is finished

2. **Check Function Logs:**
   - Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí Functions

     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "/reply NEGOTIATION_HASH Your message here"}'
   ```

2. **For Discord Bot Commands:**

   - Check if the negotiation is still active in UEX Corp
   - You can't reply to closed negotiations

2. **UEX Corp API changes:**
   - API endpoints or authentication might have changed
   - Check UEX Corp documentation for updates
