---

## Step 6: Set Up Bot Event Handler

### 6.1 Create Discord Bot Function
This step assumes you have the correct Netlify function files. If your project doesn't have a Discord bot function, you'll need to add one.

**Check if you have:** `netlify/functions/discord-bot.js`

**If missing:** This means your project might need updating to support Discord bots. Check the main repository for the latest version.

### 6.2 Register Webhook with Discord
1. **Test your bot function:**
   - Go to: `https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/discord-bot`
   - You should see a response like: `{"type": "PING"}`

2. **Configure Discord webhook** (this step requires the correct function):
   - Discord will automatically register your bot's slash commands
   - This happens when the bot comes online

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Bot is ready to receive commands.

---

## Step 7: Test Your Bot

### 7.1 Test Slash Command
1. **Go to your Discord server**
2. **In the notification channel, type:** `/reply`
3. **You should see autocomplete** showing the hash and message parameters
4. **Fill in a test command:**
   ```
   /reply hash:abc123def456 message:Hello from Discord bot!
   ```
5. **Press Enter**

### 7.2 Expected Behavior
**What should happen:**
1. ‚úÖ Bot responds immediately: "Message sent to UEX Corp!"
2. ‚úÖ Your reply appears in the UEX Corp negotiation
3. ‚úÖ If there's an error, bot tells you what went wrong

**What might go wrong:**
- ‚ùå "Unknown command" ‚Üí Bot needs time to register commands (wait 5-10 minutes)
- ‚ùå "Bot not responding" ‚Üí Check Netlify function logs
- ‚ùå "Authentication error" ‚Üí Verify UEX API keys are still valid

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You can use `/reply` commands in Discord!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Slash command not appearing"

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Discord needs time to register commands
2. **Try in a different channel** or refresh Discord
3. **Check bot permissions** - make sure it can use slash commands
4. **Re-invite the bot** with proper scopes

### Problem: "Bot not responding to commands"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Netlify function logs:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí discord-bot
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify environment variables:**
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` should be set
   - `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` should be set
   - Redeploy after adding variables

3. **Test bot function manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/discord-bot \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type": 1}'
   ```

### Problem: "Message not sent to UEX Corp"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check UEX API health:**
   - Go to: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health`
   - Verify UEX connectivity is healthy

2. **Verify negotiation hash:**
   - Make sure hash is exactly as shown in notification
   - Hash is case-sensitive

3. **Check if negotiation is still active:**
   - You can't reply to closed negotiations

## üé® Customization Options

### Custom Bot Responses
You can modify how the bot responds by editing the Discord bot function:

**Success response:**
```javascript
await interaction.reply({
  content: "‚úÖ Message sent to UEX Corp successfully!",
  ephemeral: true  // Only visible to you
});
```

**Error response:**
```javascript
await interaction.reply({
  content: "‚ùå Failed to send message: " + error.message,
  ephemeral: true
});
```

### Rich Embeds
Make bot responses look more professional:
```javascript
const embed = {
  title: "UEX Reply Sent",
  description: "Your message has been sent to the negotiation",
  color: 0x00ff00,
  fields: [
    { name: "Negotiation", value: hash.substring(0, 8) + "...", inline: true },
    { name: "Message Length", value: message.length + " characters", inline: true }
  ],
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};
```
