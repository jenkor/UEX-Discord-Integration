## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: Why Netlify? Can I use other hosting?
**A: Netlify is ideal for beginners because:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - works out of the box
- ‚úÖ **Free tier** is very generous 
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployment** from GitHub
- ‚úÖ **Built-in environment variables** for secrets
- ‚úÖ **No server management** required

**Can you use other hosting?** Yes, but you'd need to:
- Set up your own server (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Configure environment variables manually
- Handle deployment and scaling
- Manage security and SSL certificates

For beginners, Netlify is the easiest choice.

### Q: Is my data secure?
**A: Yes, we follow security best practices:**
- ‚úÖ **API keys stored securely** in Netlify environment variables
- ‚úÖ **No sensitive data logged** or stored permanently
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS encryption** for all communications
- ‚úÖ **Webhook signature verification** prevents fake requests
- ‚úÖ **No third-party tracking** or analytics

**Your UEX Corp credentials never leave your Netlify instance.**

### Q: What data is stored?
**A: Minimal data storage:**
- ‚úÖ **Temporary:** Recent negotiation hashes (for bot autocomplete)
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables:** Your API keys (encrypted by Netlify)
- ‚úÖ **Function logs:** Error messages for debugging (auto-deleted after 1 week)

**We don't store:** Messages, negotiation details, or personal information.

### Q: Can UEX Corp or Discord see my setup?
**A: Limited visibility:**
- **UEX Corp:** Only sees webhook delivery attempts (success/failure)
- **Discord:** Only sees messages sent via webhook/bot
- **Neither can see:** Your environment variables or Netlify configuration

## üí¨ Discord Integration

### Q: Why do I need both webhook URL and channel ID?
**A: They serve different purposes:**
- **Webhook URL:** Sends notifications to Discord
- **Channel ID:** Identifies the target channel for advanced features

**Think of it like mailing a letter:**
- Webhook URL = the entire postal address
- Channel ID = the apartment number

### Q: Can I send notifications to multiple channels?
**A: Not with the basic setup, but it's possible:**

**Option 1 (Easy):** Set up separate integrations
- Fork the repository multiple times
- Deploy each fork with different Discord settings
- Each gets its own Netlify site

**Option 2 (Advanced):** Modify the webhook function
- Edit `netlify/functions/uex-webhook.js`
- Add logic to send to multiple channels
- Requires some JavaScript knowledge

### Q: Can I customize notification appearance?
**A: Yes!** See our [Customization Guide](Customization-Guide) for:
- ‚úÖ **Custom colors** and emojis
- ‚úÖ **Additional fields** (date, urgency, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Rich embeds** with images and links
- ‚úÖ **Different formats** for different types of messages

### Q: Why isn't the Discord bot working?
**A: Common causes:**
1. **Commands not registered:** Wait 5-10 minutes after setup
2. **Missing permissions:** Bot needs "Use Slash Commands" permission
3. **Wrong environment variables:** Check `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`
4. **Function not deployed:** Redeploy after adding bot variables

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Q: Health check shows "false" for variables
**A: This means Netlify can't see your environment variables:**
1. **Double-check variable names** (case-sensitive)
2. **Verify all 4 variables** are set
3. **Redeploy your site** after adding variables
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Q: Getting "CORS errors"
**A: Usually means:**
1. **Function isn't deployed** yet
2. **Wrong URL** in your testing
3. **Netlify build failed** (check deploy logs)

**Solution:** Check Netlify dashboard for deploy status.

### Q: Discord notifications stopped working
**A: Check these in order:**
1. **Discord webhook still exists?** (someone might have deleted it)
2. **Channel still exists?** (server changes)
3. **UEX Corp still sending webhooks?** (check UEX settings)
4. **Netlify functions working?** (check health endpoint)

### Q: No notifications at all
**A: Diagnostic steps:**
1. **Test health endpoint** first
2. **Check UEX Corp webhook settings** (is it active?)
3. **Verify negotiation activity** (are you getting messages?)
4. **Look at Netlify function logs** for errors
